# Shell Script Bug: Silent Failure on Empty File or Line Processing

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a shell script that can lead to silent failures. The script processes a file line by line, but lacks proper error handling for empty files or errors during line processing. The solution improves the script's robustness by adding comprehensive error handling.

## Bug
The `bug.sh` script attempts to read and process a file. However, it fails silently if:

1. The input file is empty.
2. An error occurs while processing a line of the file. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.sh` script addresses these issues by:

1. Explicitly checking for the existence and emptiness of the file.
2. Adding error handling within the loop to catch and report errors during line processing. 

This improved version provides more informative error messages and prevents silent failures.
